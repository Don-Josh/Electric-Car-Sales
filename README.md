# Electric-Car-Sales

This project presents a dynamic Tableau dashboard analyzing global electric vehicle (EV) sales. It uncovers trends by region, top-selling brands and models, sales growth over time, and market adoption rates. The visualizations provide clear insights into the accelerating shift toward sustainable transportation and highlight key factors driving EV sales across different markets.

## Introduction

The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) marks a significant shift in the global automotive industry. This project explores electric car sales trends using Tableau to uncover patterns in market growth, regional adoption, and brand performance. By visualizing sales data, the project aims to provide meaningful insights into the transition toward cleaner, more sustainable transportation.

## Problem Statement

### 1. KPI's 

#### a. Total Vehicles:
  Understand the overall landscape of electric vehicles, encompassing both BEVs and PHEVs to access the markets size and growth.

#### b. Average Electric Range:

  Determine the average electric range of the electric vehicles in the dataset to gauge the technological advancements and efficiency of the EVs.

#### c. Total BEVs Vehicles and % of Total BEVs Vehicles:
- Identify and analyze the total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) in the dataset.

- Calculate the percentage of BEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, providing insights into the dominance of fully electric models.

#### d. Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:
- Identify and analyze the total number of plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles(PHEVs) in the dataset.

- Calculate the percentage of PHEVs relative to the total number of electric vehicles, offering insights into the market share of plug-in hybrid models.

### 2. Chart Requirements

#### a. Total Vehicles by Model year (from 2010 onwards):
- Visualization: Line/Area Chart.

#### b. Total Vehicles by state:
- Visualization: Map Chart.

#### c. Top 10 Total Vehicles by make:

## Key Highlights
- Total Vehicles Analyzed: 150,413

- Average Electric Range: 67.83 miles

- EV Type Distribution:

  a. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs): 116,745 (77.6%)

  b. Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs): 33,668 (22.4%)

## Insights/Key Findings

### Insights by Model Year
- A consistent growth trend is observed from 2011 to 2023, with 2023 recording the highest number of vehicle registrations (37.1K).

- This exponential rise indicates increased public interest, better infrastructure, and possible regulatory support in recent years.

### Top Manufacturers
- TESLA leads significantly with 68,939 vehicles (55.6%), followed by:

  a. NISSAN (10.89%)

  b. CHEVROLET (9.7%)

  c. FORD, BMW, and KIA

- The dominance of Tesla reflects its strong market presence and product reliability in the EV segment.

### Geographic Distribution
- Washington State accounts for the largest volume of EVs (150,082), suggesting concentrated adoption and possibly government or local support.

- Other states show significantly smaller volumes, indicating room for adoption growth and expansion efforts.

### Clean Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility
- Eligible: 62,887 (41.81%)

- Not Eligible: 17,829 (11.85%)

- Unknown: 69,697 (46.34%)

- A significant portion of entries is marked unknown, indicating potential gaps in reporting or data collection which may hinder incentive effectiveness tracking.

### Top Models
- Model Y (TESLA) tops the chart with 28,501 units, followed by:

  - Model 3, Leaf (Nissan), Model S, and Bolt EV

- These models form the backbone of consumer preference in EV purchases.

## Strategic Recommendations
- Expand Incentive Awareness: Address the 46% CAFV unknowns by improving documentation and public awareness of clean energy incentives.

- Focus on Low-Adoption States: States with minimal EV adoption could benefit from targeted campaigns, infrastructure support, and policy development.

- Market Diversification: While Tesla dominates, opportunities exist for other manufacturers to expand their EV offerings and market share.

- Optimize for Range: The average electric range (67.83 miles) suggests a potential demand for longer-range vehicles, especially in rural regions.
